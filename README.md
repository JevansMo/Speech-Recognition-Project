# Speech-Recognition-Project
A beginner project that mimics voice activated assistants using a raspberry pi.


How to activate:

For command line commands, you must use the word: "Command" before then declaring the command you for the program to execute.

Weather Commands -> "temperature", "condition"
For weather commands, you must use the word: "Weather" and then state the city before declaring what aspect of the weather you wish to see
